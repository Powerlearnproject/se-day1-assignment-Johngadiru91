Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
The three significant milestones in software engineering history:

1. Development of Programming Languages (1950s-1960s)
Early programming languages like Fortran and C were developed, making software development more structured and efficient.
These languages enabled programmers to write reusable and maintainable code, laying the foundation for modern software engineering.
2. Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1960s)
The term "software engineering" was formally recognized in the 1960s as a response to the increasing complexity of software systems.
Engineers started using systematic methods to design, develop, and test software, improving quality and reliability.
3. Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s)
Traditional software development methods were often rigid and slow, leading to the rise of agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.
Agile promotes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and improve software efficiently.
These milestones have shaped the way modern software is developed, making it more efficient, scalable, and adaptable to user needs

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several key phases:
i)Requirements
Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements to define what the software should do.

ii) Design
Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface before development begins.

iii) Implementation
Writing the actual code and building the software according to the design specifications.

iv) Testing
Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements, fixing any bugs found.

v) Deployment
Releasing the software to users or customers, making it available for use.

vi) Maintenance
Providing ongoing support, updates, and improvements to keep the software running smoothly after deployment.

Each phase in the SDLC ensures the software is high-quality, meets user expectations, stays within budget and timeline, and remains compatible with new technologies
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i) Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in Software Development
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance: IDEs provide a complete set of tools for writing, debugging, and testing code in a single application. They help developers write efficient code by offering syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging features, and project management tools.
Examples:
Visual Studio – Used for .NET and C++ development.
Eclipse – Common for Java development.
IntelliJ IDEA – Popular among Java and Kotlin developers.

ii) Version Control Systems (VCS) 
Importance: VCS helps teams collaborate by tracking changes in source code, preventing conflicts, and maintaining a history of modifications. It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
Examples:
Git – The most widely used VCS, often combined with platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
Subversion (SVN) – An older but still-used centralized version control system.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers & Strategies to Overcome Them
i) Changing Requirements
Challenge: Requirements may evolve during development, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Strategy: Adopt agile methodologies to accommodate changes iteratively. Maintain clear communication with stakeholders and document requirements effectively.

ii) Tight Deadlines
Challenge: Pressure to deliver software on schedule can lead to rushed development and compromised quality.
Strategy: Use effective project management techniques like task prioritization and timeboxing. Break work into manageable sprints and ensure realistic timelines are set.

iii) Technical Debt
Challenge: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt increases maintenance costs and hinders future development.
Strategy: Follow best coding practices, conduct regular code reviews, and allocate time for refactoring to minimize long-term issues.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective questions or statements to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and meaningful responses. It involves structuring prompts in a way that optimizes the model’s output, ensuring clarity and specificity.

Importance of Prompt Engineering
i) Enhances AI Interactions – Well-structured prompts lead to more precise and useful AI-generated responses.
ii) Improves Efficiency – Reduces the need for multiple iterations by refining the prompt to get the desired output.
iii) Optimizes AI Applications – Used in chatbots, virtual assistants, content creation, and decision-making support systems.
iv) Encourages Better AI Understanding – Helps bridge the gap between human intent and AI responses by providing clear instructions.
By mastering prompt engineering, users can maximize the potential of AI tools, improving their usability in real-world applications

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt can be like, define the?
Example of a Vague Prompt vs. Improved Prompt
Vague Prompt:
"What problems do street children face?"
Improved Prompt:
"Analyze the daily challenges faced by street children in Kibera, Nairobi, focusing on access to education, healthcare barriers, and exposure to gang violence. Include examples of local NGO interventions addressing these issues since 2020."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
Specificity:
The vague prompt ("What problems...") is too broad and could apply to any global context.
The improved prompt narrows the focus to Kibera, Nairobi (a specific area), identifies key challenges (education, healthcare, gang violence), and asks for local examples (NGO interventions post-2020).
Actionable Scope:
The vague prompt risks generic answers like "lack of shelter" or "poverty."
The improved version demands targeted analysis (e.g., "How do gangs in Kibera exploit street children?" or "Why do clinics in Nairobi’s informal settlements turn them away?").
Contextual Relevance:
The improved prompt acknowledges local dynamics (e.g., Kibera’s status as one of Africa’s largest informal settlements) and recent efforts (NGO work since 2020), ensuring responses are grounded in real-world data.
Clear Structure:
It guides the responder to address three distinct issues (education, healthcare, violence) and solutions, making the answer organized and practical.
